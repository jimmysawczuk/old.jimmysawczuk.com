# Welcome #

This is a repository for the theme that runs my blog, which is located at [www.jimmysawczuk.com][1]. 

## Original ##

The theme currently in the `lightword` branch is only slightly modified from an older version of [Andrei Luca's][2] [LightWord][3]. It has served me well for two years, however, I feel it's time for a change.

## In use ##

The theme in use now was written from scratch with some inspiration from [`lightword`][3], [Grantland][6], and the [New York Times][7]. My aim was to create a theme that was simple, attractive and clean. I also built it with Facebook integration in mind, and specifically, to respect the [Open Graph protocol][8]. It uses HTML5 and CSS3, with some jQuery.
