# Welcome #

This is a repository for the theme that runs my blog, which is located at [www.jimmysawczuk.com][1]. 

## Original ##

The theme currently in the `production` branch is only slightly modified from an older version of [Andrei Luca's][2] LightWord. It has served me well for two years, however, I feel it's time for a change.

## In development ##

The theme in development aims to be simple, clean, and able to integrate well with Facebook and other social networks. It uses HTML5.
