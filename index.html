        <h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This is a repository for the theme that runs my blog, which is located at <a href="http://www.jimmysawczuk.com">www.jimmysawczuk.com</a>. </p>

<h2>Original</h2>

<p>The theme currently in the <code>lightword</code> branch is only slightly modified from an older version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/profile/andreiluca">Andrei Luca's</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/lightword">LightWord</a>. It has served me well for two years, however, I feel it's time for a change.</p>

<h2>In use</h2>

<p>The theme in use now was written from scratch with some inspiration from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/lightword"><code>lightword</code></a>, <a href="http://www.grantland.com">Grantland</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>. My aim was to create a theme that was simple, attractive and clean. I also built it with Facebook integration in mind, and specifically, to respect the <a href="http://ogp.me">Open Graph protocol</a>. It uses HTML5 and CSS3, with some jQuery.</p>

<h3>Repository Hooks</h3>

<p>To display the current code revision in the footer, I use this hook on both <code>post-checkout</code> and <code>post-merge</code>:</p>

<pre><code>includes/update_revision.sh;
rm -rf /path/to/wp/cache/directory/*
</code></pre>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>I used all or parts of these open-source projects in this theme:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://timeago.yarp.com/">TimeAgo</a>, for the relative timestamps on the BitBucket widget.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/minify/">Minify</a>, for the on-the-fly minification of my CSS and JS. There are a couple modifications to this Minify installation. The most notable one is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/AlternateFileLayouts">this workaround</a> that enables Minify to run in a subdirectory of the document root. It's also configured to use group loading rather than file loading, check <code>min/groupsConfig.php</code> for the configuration.</li>
</ul><p>Special thanks also to the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/">Google Font API</a>, for the gorgeous fonts, namely: <strong>Arvo</strong> and <strong>Mako</strong></p>
