{"name":"JimmySawczuk.com","body":"# Welcome #\r\n\r\nThis is a repository for the theme that runs my blog, which is located at [www.jimmysawczuk.com][1]. \r\n\r\n## Original ##\r\n\r\nThe theme currently in the `lightword` branch is only slightly modified from an older version of [Andrei Luca's][2] [LightWord][3]. It has served me well for two years, however, I feel it's time for a change.\r\n\r\n## In use ##\r\n\r\nThe theme in use now was written from scratch with some inspiration from [`lightword`][3], [Grantland][6], and the [New York Times][7]. My aim was to create a theme that was simple, attractive and clean. I also built it with Facebook integration in mind, and specifically, to respect the [Open Graph protocol][8]. It uses HTML5 and CSS3, with some jQuery.\r\n\r\n### Repository Hooks ###\r\n\r\nTo display the current code revision in the footer, I use this hook on both `post-checkout` and `post-merge`:\r\n\r\n\tincludes/update_revision.sh;\r\n\trm -rf /path/to/wp/cache/directory/*\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements ###\r\n\r\nI used all or parts of these open-source projects in this theme:\r\n\r\n* [TimeAgo][9], for the relative timestamps on the BitBucket widget.\r\n* [Minify][10], for the on-the-fly minification of my CSS and JS. There are a couple modifications to this Minify installation. The most notable one is [this workaround][13] that enables Minify to run in a subdirectory of the document root. It's also configured to use group loading rather than file loading, check `min/groupsConfig.php` for the configuration.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks also to the [Google Font API][11], for the gorgeous fonts, namely: **Arvo** and **Mako**\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThe code in `lightword` is protected under the [GPL license][4], as it is a very slight deviation on the Lightword theme.
